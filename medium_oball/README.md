This is an adapter to create wind protection with vibration isolation from an Oball baby toy and two Rycote Lyre suspensions. 

The base is compatible with Arca Swiss sized tripod heads, including square ones (like the [Peak Design travel tripod](https://www.peakdesign.com/pages/travel-tripod). The base is also threaded for 3/8" tripod screws, or use an [3/8" to 1/4" threaded insert](https://www.google.com/search?q=3%2F8+to+1%2F4+adapter+tripod) for tripods with 1/4" threads.
